/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for AgroSense.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset is designed for an application where authentication is handled
 * by a backend service (e.g., Cloud Functions) using API keys, not by
 * end-user Firebase Authentication. Therefore, the default security posture
 * is to DENY all direct client-side reads and writes. All data access must
 * be brokered by the trusted backend service, which will have administrative
 * privileges.
 *
 * This approach ensures that all access control logic, including API key
 * validation, is centralized in the backend, providing a single point of
 * security management and preventing unauthorized client access.
